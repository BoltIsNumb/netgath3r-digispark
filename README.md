It's a password stealer coded for the digispark, the poor mans rubber ducky. Basically it downloads an app which saves and emails you the victims stored passwords from google chrome. Don't use it for anything illegal it's only for educational purposes.

Configure the email you want your passwords to be sent in the source code
