It's a password stealer coded for the digispark, the poor mans rubber ducky. Basically it downloads an app which saves and emails you the victims stored passwords from google chrome. Don't use it for anything illegal it's only for educational purposes.

How to use:

Configure the email you want your passwords to be sent in the source code.

Download WebBrowserPassView tool from nirsoft, google it.
Upload it to mediafire or any other file hosting website.
Copy and paste the direct download link in the [DROPPER LINK] in the source code.


Upload the script to your digispark and off you go!
